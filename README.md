# Advanced Social Text and Media Analytics

This Jupyter Notebook project provides a comprehensive analysis of text and media content using various natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The project is divided into several sections, each focusing on a different aspect of text analysis and media content understanding. Below, you'll find a brief description of each section:

## 1. Movie Sentiment Analysis
In this section, we perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews or comments. We classify text data as positive, negative, or neutral to gauge audience sentiment towards specific movies.

## 2. Named Entity Recognition using Spacy
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a critical task in information extraction. Using the Spacy library, we identify and classify named entities such as names of people, organizations, locations, and more in the text.

## 3. Stemming & Lemmatization
Stemming and lemmatization are text normalization techniques. We explore both methods to reduce words to their root forms, aiding in text analysis and understanding.

## 4. Bag of Words
The Bag of Words (BoW) model is a fundamental NLP technique. In this section, we create BoW representations of text data, which are used in various NLP tasks, such as text classification and clustering.

## 5. Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
TF-IDF is a numerical statistic that reflects the importance of a term within a document corpus. We calculate TF-IDF scores for terms in our text data to understand their significance.

## 6. Stopwords
Stopwords are common words that are often removed during text preprocessing to improve the efficiency and quality of NLP tasks. We discuss their role and demonstrate their removal.

## 7. POS Tagging
Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging is a process that assigns a grammatical category (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) to each word in a sentence. We use POS tagging to gain insights into the structure of text.

## 8. Chunking
Chunking is a technique to group words into meaningful phrases or chunks. We apply chunking to extract essential information from text, such as noun phrases or verb phrases.

## 9. WordNet
WordNet is a lexical database that provides semantic relationships between words. We explore WordNet to find synonyms, antonyms, and hyponyms of words, enhancing our text understanding.

## 10. Word Cloud
Word clouds are visual representations of text data, with word size indicating frequency. We create word clouds to visualize the most common words in our dataset, helping us identify key themes or topics.

Each section of this project is documented with code examples and explanations in the Jupyter Notebook. Feel free to explore the individual sections according to your interests or requirements. Enjoy analyzing and gaining insights from text and media content!
